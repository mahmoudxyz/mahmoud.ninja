                <h2>Hello, I'm Mahmoud üëã</h2>
                <p>Software Engineer who took the scenic route through pharmacy school before realizing I preferred debugging code over counting pills. Now I write about computational biology because apparently I like making simple things complicated.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>What I Actually Do ‚ö°</h2>
                <p>I build scalable solutions (that sometimes scale), write technical blogs (that sometimes make sense), and firmly believe gene therapy will save humanity (probably before my code does).</p>
                <p>Fun fact: I went from "take two and call me in the morning" to "have you tried turning it off and on again?"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>My Superpowers ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Converting caffeine directly into semicolons</li>
                    <li>Making biology sound like rocket science (it basically is)</li>
                    <li>Believing in open-source harder than most people believe in anything</li>
                    <li>Explaining why my localhost works but production doesn't</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>Why I Write üìù</h2>
                <p>Because apparently talking to rubber ducks wasn't therapeutic enough. I share knowledge about code, biology, and the intersection where they meet to create beautiful chaos.</p>
                <p>Also, future me needs to remember how I solved that weird bug at 3 AM.</p>
